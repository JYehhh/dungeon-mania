# dungeon-mania

## Overview.

In this group assignment, we developed the backend for a rogue-like game using object-oriented programming principles. Our primary focus was to create a well-designed and efficient software system using design patterns to ensure maintainability, flexibility, and scalability.

The game we developed features an environment where players can explore, solve puzzles, and interact with various characters and objects. The backend system manages the game state, including player progression, item inventory, and game events. We designed the game to be easily extensible, allowing for the addition of new levels, characters, items, and challenges without modifying the core system.

Our team collaborated effectively to plan, design, and implement the backend components, taking into consideration the best practices and techniques of object-oriented programming. Throughout the development process, we paid close attention to code quality, documentation, and testing, to ensure a robust and reliable gaming experience.

## How to run the program.

You need the "Extension Pack for Java" extension downloaded in VS Code. After which, navigate to src/java/App.py and click "start" to run the game.

## Design Patterns.

During the development of the backend, we utilized various design patterns to enhance the quality of our code and make it more maintainable and extensible. Some of the design patterns we employed are:
- Observer Pattern
- State Pattern
- Composite Pattern
- Factory Pattern
- Strategy Pattern
